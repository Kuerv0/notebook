1.0
Explain the advances in modern network technologies.
Install Cisco Packet Tracer.

1.1
"Communication is almost as important to us as our reliance on air, water, food,
and shelter".
bold claim.

1.2
Host can be called end devices, sometimes clients. 

An IP address identifies the host and the network to which the host is attached.

As mentioned before, clients are a type of host. Clients have software for
requesting and displaying the information obtained from the server. An example
of client software is a web browser, like Chrome or FireFox.

Peer-to-peer refers to a computer being server and client.

Advantages:
  - Easy to set up
  - Less complex
  - Lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may no te be
    required
  - Can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing
    printers

Disadvantages:
  - No centralized administration
  - Not as secure
  - Not scalable
  - All devices may act as both clients and serves which slow performance

To distinguish one end device from another, each end device on a network has an
address.

Intermediary devices connect the individual end devices to the network.

Intermediary network devices perform some or all of these functions:
  - Regenerate and retransmit communication signals.
  - Maintain information about what pathways exist through the network and
    internetwork
  - Notify other devices of errors and communication failure
  - Classify and direct messages according to priorites
  - Permit or deny the flow of data, based on security settings

Modern networks primarily use three types of media to interconnect devices
  - Metal wires within cables - Electrical impulses
  - Glass or plastic fibers within cables (fiber-optic-cable) - Pulses of light
  - Wireless transmission - Modulation of specific frequencies of waves

The four main criteria for choosing network media are these:
  - What is the maximum distance that the media can successfully carry a
    signal?
  - What is the environment in which the media will be installed?
  - What is the amount of data and at what speed must it be transmitted?
  - What is the cost of the media and installation?

1.3

Diagrams of networks often use symbols to represent the different devices and
connections that make up a network. This type of “picture” of a network is known
as a topology diagram.

In addition to these representations, specialized terminology is used to
describe how each of these devices and media connect to each other:
  - Network Interface Card (NIC): A NIC physically connects the end device to
    the network. 
  - Physical Port: A connector or outlet on a networking device where the media
    connects to an end device or another networking device. 
  - Interface: Specialized ports on a networking device that connect to
    individual networks. Because routers connect networks, the ports on a router
    are referred to as network interfaces. 

The terms port and interface are often used interchangeably.

Topology diagrams are mandatory for anyone working with a network. There are two
types of topology diagrams: physical and logical.
  - Physical topology diagrams illustrate the physical location of intermediary
    devices and cable installation
  - Logical topology diagrams illustrate devices, ports, and the addressing
    scheme of the network

1.4

Networks range from simple networks consisting of two computers, to networks
connecting millions of devices.

Small office and home office (SOHO) networks allow people to work from home, or
a remote office.

The internet is the largest network in existence. In fact, the term internet
means a “network of networks”. It is a collection of interconnected private and
public networks.

Network infrastructures vary greatly in terms of:
  - Size of the area covered
  - Number of users connected
  - Number and types of services available
  - Area of responsibility

LANs -> Local Area Networks (department, home, small business)
WANs -> Wide Area Networks (managed by a larger corporation)

LANs have specific characteristics:
  - LANs interconnect end devices in a limited area such as a home, school,
    office building, or campus.
  - A LAN is usually administered by a single organization or individual.
    Administrative control is enforced at the network level and governs the
    security and access control policies.
  - LANs provide high-speed bandwidth to internal end devices and intermediary
    devices.

WANs have specific characteristics:
  - WANs interconnect LANs over wide geographical areas such as between cities,
    states, provinces, countries, or continents.
  - WANs are usually administered by multiple service providers.
  - WANs typically provide slower speed links between LANs.

The internet is not owned by any individual or group. Ensuring effective
communication across this diverse infrastructure requires the application of
consistent and commonly recognized technologies and standards as well as the
cooperation of many network administration agencies. There are organizations
that were developed to help maintain the structure and standardization of
internet protocols and processes. These organizations include the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF), Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers (ICANN), and the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), plus many others.

An intranet is designed to be accessible only by the organization's members,
employees, or others with authorization.

An organization may use an extranet to provide secure and safe access to
individuals who work for a different organization but require access to the
organization’s data. Here are some examples of extranets:
  - A company that is providing access to outside suppliers and contractors
  - A hospital that is providing a booking system to doctors so they can make
    appointments for their patients
  - A local office of education that is providing budget and personnel
    information to the schools in its district

ISP -> Internet Service Provider

Common connections for users:

Cable
  - DSL -> Digital Subscriber Lines
    - ADSL -> download speed faster than upload speed.
  - Cellular
  - Satellite
  - Dial-up telephone

Business Internet Connection
  - Dedicated Leased Line
  - Metro Ethernet
  - Business DSL
  - Satellite

Traditional Separate Networks -> Multiple services ran on multiple networks.
Converged Networks -> Carry multiple services on one network.

1.6
We have learned that there are four basic characteristics that network
architects must address to meet user expectations:
  - Fault Tolerance
      A fault tolerant network is one that limits the number of affected devices
      during a failure.
      
  - Scalability
      A scalable network expands quickly to support new users and applications.
      
  - Quality of Service (QoS)
      The type of traffic, not the content of the traffic, is what is important.
      
  - Security
      Network administrators must address two types of network security
      concerns: network infrastructure security and information security.
      Network administrators must also protect the information contained within
      the packets being transmitted over the network, and the information stored
      on network attached devices.
        - Confidentiality
        - Integrity
        - Availability

1.7

There are several networking trends that affect organizations and consumers:

  - Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
     enables end users the freedom to use personal tools to access information
     and communicate across a business or campus network. BYOD means any device,
     with any ownership, used anywhere.
     
  - Online collaboration
    Collaboration is a critical and strategic priority that organizations are
    using to remain competitive.
    
  - Video communications
    Video is becoming a critical requirement for effective collaboration as
    organizations extend across geographic and cultural boundaries.
  
  - Cloud Computing
    Cloud computing allows us to store personal files, even backup an entire
    drive on servers over the internet.
    Data centers are facilities used to house computer systems and associated
    components.

    There are four primary types of clouds:
    
      - Public clouds
          Available to the general population. Services may be free or are
          offered on a pay-per-use model.

      - Private clouds
          Intended for a specific organization or entity, such as a government.
          A private cloud can be set up using the organization’s private
          network.

      - Hybrid clouds
          A hybrid cloud is made up of two or more clouds

      - Community clouds
          A community cloud is created for exclusive use by specific entities or
          organizations.
  
Smart home technology integrates into every-day appliances, which can then
connect with other devices to make the appliances more ‘smart’ or automated.

Powerline networking for home networks uses existing electrical wiring to
connect devices

WISP -> Wireless Internet Service Provider. Common in rural environments.

Another wireless solution for the home and small businesses is wireless
broadband. This solution uses the same cellular technology as a smart phone.

Network security must consider the environment, as well as the tools and
requirements of the network. It must be able to secure data while still
allowing for the quality of service that users expect of the network.

There are several common external threats to networks:
  - Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses: These contain malicious software or code
    running on a user device.

  - Spyware and adware: These are types of software which are installed on a
    user’s device. The software then secretly collects information about the
    user.

  - Zero-day attacks: Also called zero-hour attacks, these occur on the first
    day that a vulnerability becomes known.

  - Threat actor attacks: A malicious person attacks user devices or network
    resources.

  - Denial of service attacks: These attacks slow or crash applications and
    processes on a network device.

  - Data interception and theft: This attack captures private information from
    an organization’s network.

  - Identity theft: This attack steals the login credentials of a user in order
    to access private data.

With the evolving BYOD strategies, corporate data is much more vulnerable.
Therefore, when developing a security policy, it is important to address both
external and internal security threats.

These are the basic security components for a home or small office network:
  - Antivirus and antispyware - These applications help to protect end devices
    from becoming infected with malicious software.
    
  - Firewall filtering - Firewall filtering blocks unauthorized access into and
    out of the network. This may include a host-based firewall system that
    prevents unauthorized access to the end device, or a basic filtering service
    on the home router to prevent unauthorized access from the outside world
    into the network.

Larger networks and corporate networks use antivirus, antispyware, and firewall
filtering, but they also have other security requirements:
  - Dedicated firewall systems - These provide more advanced firewall
    capabilities that can filter large amounts of traffic with more granularity.

  - Access control lists (ACL) - These further filter access and traffic
    forwarding based on IP addresses and applications.

  - Intrusion prevention systems (IPS) - These identify fast-spreading threats,
    such as zero-day or zero-hour attacks.

  - Virtual private networks (VPN) - These provide secure access into an
    organization for remote workers.

The study of network security threats and mitigation techniques starts with a
clear understanding of the underlying switching and routing infrastructure used
to organize network services.

A consolidated and updated CCNA for networking engineers is three courses and
one exam which covers the fundamental topics for all network technologies. The
new CCNA focuses on IP foundation and security topics along with wireless,
virtualization, automation, and network programmability.

Teoría: 2 Basic Switch and End Device Configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.0
8/31/2023 15:37:02

As part of your career in networking, you might have to set up a new network or
maintain and upgrade an existing one. In either case, you’ll configure switches
and end devices so that they are secure and perform effectively based on your
requirements.

2.1
All end devices and network devices require an operating system (OS). The
portion of the OS that interacts directly with computer hardware is known as the
kernel. The portion that interfaces with applications and the user is known as
the shell. The user can interact with the shell using a command-line interface
(CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI).

  - Shell: The user interface that allows to request specific tasks from the
    computer. These requests can be made either through the CLI or GUI
    interfaces.
  - Kernel: Communicates between the hardware and software of a computer and
    manages how hardware resources are used to meet software requiremetns.
  - Hardware: The physical part of a computer including underlying
    electronics.

GUIs may not always be able to provide all the features available with the CLI.
GUIs can also fail. For these reasons, network devices are typically accessed
through a CLI. 

The family of network operating systems used on many Cisco devices is called the
Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS). *

Other Cisco operating systems include IOS XE, IOS XR, and NX-OS. *

The operating system on home routers is usually called firmware. The most common
method for configuring a home router is by using a web browser-based GUI.

A switch will forward traffic by default and does not need to be explicitly
configured to operate. Regardless of the default behavior of a new switch, all
switches should be configured and secured.

Ways to access a switch:
  - Console (No remote)
  - SSH (Is secure)
  - Telnet (is not secure)
  - Legacy auxiliary port for telephone connections (Some devices)

Terminal Emulation Programs
  - PuTTY
  - Tera Term
  - SecureCRT

2.2

User EXEC Mode: 
Limited capabilities, but useful for basic operations. Also called "view-only"
mode.

Priviledged EXEC Mode: 
Allows access to all commands and features. 

Switch(config)# Configuration mode
Switch(config-line)# Line configuration mode
Switch(config-if)# Interface configuration mode

important commands:
  >enable
  #disable
  #configure terminal
  #(...)exit
  #line console 0 -> management interface console port
  #line vty 0 15 -> remote administrator access
  #interface vlan 1 -> vlan configuration
  #interface fastethernet 0/1 -> fast ethernet interface
  #(...)end -> Return to privileged EXEC mode
  #(...)<C-z> -> Return to privileged EXEC mode

2.3
9/1/2023 16:38:49

A network administrator must know the basic IOS command structure to be able to
use the CLI for device configuration.

Keyword is defined by the OS
Argument is a value or variable

To determine the keywords and arguments required for a command, refer to the
command syntax.

| Convention | Description      |
|:----------:|:----------------:|
| Boldface   | Keywords         |
| Italics    | Arguments        |
| [x]        | Optional element |
| {x}        | Required element |
| [x {y|z}]  | Required choice  |

The Cisco IOS Command Reference is the ultimate source of information for a
particular IOS command.

To access context-sensitive help, simply enter a question mark, ?, at the CLI.

If the interpreter cannot understand the command being entered, it will provide
feedback describing what is wrong with the command.

the configure command can be shortened to conf because configure is the only
command that begins with conf.

| Keystroke   | Description                                       |

Ctrl-Shift-6 -> All-purpose break sequence

2.4

Here are some important naming guidelines for hosts:
  - Start with a letter
  - Contain no spaces
  - End with a letter or digit
  - Use only letters, digits, and dashes
  - Be less than 64 characters in length

There are some key points to consider when choosing passwords:
  - Use passwords that are more than eight characters in length.
  - Use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, special
    characters, and/or numeric sequences.
  - Avoid using the same password for all devices.
  - Do not use common words because they are easily guessed.

To encrypt all plaintext passwords, use the service password-encryption

2.5

There are two system files that store the device configuration:

startup-config -> NVRAM -> show startup-config
running-config -> RAM -> show running-config

copy running-config startup-config -> Save configuration in NVRAM.

#dir nvram: -> Shows startup-config file

2.6

The use of IP addresses is the primary means of enabling devices to locate one
another and establish end-to-end communication on the internet.

An IPv4 subnet mask is a 32-bit value that differentiates the network portion of
the address from the host portion.

IPv6 addresses are not case-sensitive and can be written in either lowercase or
uppercase.

DHCP -> Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

#configure terminal
(config)#interface vlan 1
(config-if)# ip address [ip] [mask]
(config-if)# no shutdown

#show ip interface brief -> List ip addresses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teoría: 3 Protocols and Models
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9/3/2023 14:48:29

3.0
Models give you a way to visualize the rules and their place in your network.

3.1
Devices exist within their own bubble and are unaware of the network; protocols
handle the communication between them.

All communication methods have the following three elements in common:
  - Message (sender)
  - Message destination (receiver)
  - Channel

Protocols are communication rules.

Common computer protocols include the following requirements:
  - Message encoding
  - Message formatting and encapsulation
  - Message size
  - Message timing
  - Message delivery options

Encoding is the process of converting information into another acceptable form,
for transmission. Decoding reverses this process to interpret the information.

Message formats depend on the type of message and the channel that is used to
deliver the message.

Message formats depend on the type of message and the channel that is used to
deliver the message. A common example of requiring the correct format in human
communications is when sending a letter.

Another rule of communication is message size. When a long message is sent from
one host to another over a network, it is necessary to break the message into
smaller pieces.

Message timing includes the following:
  - Flow control: Managing the rate of data transmission.

  - Response Timeout: Protocols that specify how long to wait for responses and
    what actions to take if a response timeout occurs.

  - Access method: This determines when someone can send a message.

Three types of data communications include:
  - Unicast: Information is being transmitted to a single end device.
  - Multicast: Information is being transmitted to a one or more end devices.
  - Broadcast: Information is being transmitted to all end devices.

3.2

Protocols are implemented by end devices and intermediary devices in software,
hardware, or both.

Protocol types:
  - Network Communications Protocols: Protocols enable two or more devices to
    communicate over one or more networks. The Ethernet family of technologies
    involves a variety of protocols such as IP, Transmission Control Protocol
    (TCP), HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and many more.
    
  - Network Security Protocols: Protocols secure data to provide authentication,
    data integrity, and data encryption. Examples of secure protocols include
    Secure Shell (SSH), Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), and Transport Layer Security
    (TLS).

  - Routing Protocols: Protocols enable routers to exchange route information,
    compare path information, and then to select the best path to the
    destination network. Examples of routing protocols include Open Shortest
    Path First (OSPF) and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).

  - Service Discovery Protocols: Protocols are used for the automatic detection
    of devices or services. Examples of service discovery protocols include
    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) which discovers services for IP
    address allocation, and Domain Name System (DNS) which is used to perform
    name-to-IP address translation.

Function of Protocols:
  - Addressing: This identifies the sender and the intended receiver of the
    message using a defined addressing scheme. Examples of protocols that
    provide addressing include Ethernet, IPv4, and IPv6.

  - Reliability: This function provides guaranteed delivery mechanisms in case
    messages are lost or corrupted in transit. TCP provides guaranteed
    delivery.

  - Flow control: This function ensures that data flows at an efficient rate
    between two communicating devices. TCP provides flow control services.

  - Sequencing: This function uniquely labels each transmitted segment of
    data. The receiving device uses the sequencing information to reassemble the
    information correctly. This is useful if the data segments are lost, delayed
    or received out-of-order. TCP provides sequencing services.

  - Error detection: This function is used to determine if data became corrupted
    during transmission. Various protocols that provide error detection include
    Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6, and TCP.

  - Application Interface: This function contains information used for
    process-to-process communications between network applications. For example,
    when accessing a web page, HTTP or HTTPS protocols are used to communicate
    between the client and server web processes.

3.3

A protocol suite is a set of protocols that work together to provide
comprehensive network communication services.
Protocol suites are designed to work with each other seamlessly.
A protocol suite is a group of inter-related protocols necessary to perform a
communication function.

During the evolution of network communications and the internet there were
several competing protocol suites, for instance: TCP/IP, ISO, AppleTalk, Novell
Netware.

TCP/IP protocols are available for the application, transport, and internet
layers. There are no TCP/IP protocols in the network access layer.

Today, the TCP/IP protocol suite includes many protocols and continues to evolve
to support new services.

Application Layer Protocols:

Name System:
  - DNS - Domain Name System. Translates domain names such as cisco.com, into IP
    addresses.

Host Config:
  - DHCPv4 - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4. A DHCPv4 server
    dynamically assigns IPv4 addressing information to DHCPv4 clients at
    start-up and allows the addresses to be re-used when no longer needed.

  - DHCPv6 - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6. DHCPv6 is similar to
    DHCPv4. A DHCPv6 server dynamically assigns IPv6 addressing information to
    DHCPv6 clients at start-up.

  - SLAAC - Stateless Address Autoconfiguration. A method that allows a device
    to obtain its IPv6 addressing information without using a DHCPv6 server.

Email:
  - SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. Enables clients to send email to a
    mail server and enables servers to send email to other servers.

  - POP3 - Post Office Protocol version 3. Enables clients to retrieve email
    from a mail server and download the email to the client's local mail
    application.

  - IMAP - Internet Message Access Protocol. Enables clients to access email
    stored on a mail server as well as maintaining email on the server.

File Transfer:
  - FTP - File Transfer Protocol. Sets the rules that enable a user on one host
    to access and transfer files to and from another host over a network. FTP is
    a reliable, connection-oriented, and acknowledged file delivery protocol.
  
  - SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol. As an extension to Secure Shell (SSH)
    protocol, SFTP can be used to establish a secure file transfer session in
    which the file transfer is encrypted. SSH is a method for secure remote
    login that is typically used for accessing the command line of a device.
  
  - TFTP - Trivial File Transfer Protocol. A simple, connectionless file
    transfer protocol with best-effort, unacknowledged file delivery. It uses
    less overhead than FTP. Web and Web Service

  - HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol. A set of rules for exchanging text,
    graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files on the World Wide
    Web.
  
  - HTTPS - HTTP Secure. A secure form of HTTP that encrypts the data that is
    exchanged over the World Wide Web.
  
  - REST - Representational State Transfer. A web service that uses application
    programming interfaces (APIs) and HTTP requests to create web applications.

Transport layer:

Connection-Oriented:
  - TCP - Transmission Control Protocol. Enables reliable communication between
    processes running on separate hosts and provides reliable, acknowledged
    transmissions that confirm successful delivery.

Connectionless:
  - UDP - User Datagram Protocol. Enables a process running on one host to send
    packets to a process running on another host. However, UDP does not confirm
    successful datagram transmission.

Internet Layer:

Internet Protocol:
  - IPv4 - Internet Protocol version 4. Receives message segments from the
    transport layer, packages messages into packets, and addresses packets for
    end-to-end delivery over a network. IPv4 uses a 32-bit address.
    
  - IPv6 - IP version 6. Similar to IPv4 but uses a 128-bit address.
  
  - NAT - Network Address Translation. Translates IPv4 addresses from a private
    network into globally unique public IPv4 addresses.

Messaging:
  - ICMPv4 - Internet Control Message Protocol for IPv4. Provides feedback from
    a destination host to a source host about errors in packet delivery.
    
  - ICMPv6 - ICMP for IPv6. Similar functionality to ICMPv4 but is used for IPv6
    packets.
    
  - ICMPv6 ND - ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery. Includes four protocol messages that
    are used for address resolution and duplicate address detection.
  
Routing Protocols:
  - OSPF - Open Shortest Path First. Link-state routing protocol that uses a
    hierarchical design based on areas. OSPF is an open standard interior
    routing protocol.

  - EIGRP - EIGRP - Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol. An open standard
    routing protocol developed by Cisco that uses a composite metric based on
    bandwidth, delay, load and reliability.

  - BGP - Border Gateway Protocol. An open standard exterior gateway routing
    protocol used between Internet Service Providers (ISPs). BGP is also
    commonly used between ISPs and their large private clients to exchange
    routing information.

Network Access Layer:
Address Resolution:
  - ARP - Address Resolution Protocol. Provides dynamic address mapping between
    an IPv4 address and a hardware address.

Data Link Protocols
  - Ethernet - Defines the rules for wiring and signaling standards of the
    network access layer.
    
  - WLAN - Wireless Local Area Network. Defines the rules for wireless signaling
    across the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio frequencies.

Esta parte del módulo la debo repasar muy bien. *

Standard organizations:
  - Internet Society (ISOC) - Responsible for promoting the open development and
    evolution of internet use throughout the world.

Complex concepts such as how a network operates can be difficult to explain and
understand. For this reason, a layered model is used to modularize the
operations of a network into manageable layers.

there are two layered models that are used to describe network operations:
  - Open System Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model
  - TCP/IP Reference Model

OSI model layers
  - Application: The application layer contains protocols used for
    process-to-process communications.

  - Presentation: The presentation layer provides for common representation of
    the data transferred between application layer services.

  - Session: The session layer provides services to the presentation layer to
    organize its dialogue and to manage data exchange.

  - Transport: 	The transport layer defines services to segment, transfer, and
    reassemble the data for individual communications between the end devices.

  - Network: The network layer provides services to exchange the individual
    pieces of data over the network between identified end devices.

  - Data Link: The data link layer protocols describe methods for exchanging
    data frames between devices over a common media

  - Physical: The physical layer protocols describe the mechanical, electrical,
    functional, and procedural means to activate, maintain, and de-activate
    physical connections for a bit transmission to and from a network device.

The TCP/IP protocol model for internetwork communications was created in the
early 1970s and is sometimes referred to as the internet model.
  - Application: Represents data to the user, plus encoding and dialog
    control.
  
  - Transport: Supports communication between various devices across diverse
    networks.
  
  - Internet: Determines the best path through the network.
  
  - Network Access: Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the
    network.

Debo volver a hacer el labo de 3.5, está bueno. *

3.6
Segmentation is the process of dividing a stream of data into smaller units for
transmissions over the network.

Segmenting messages has two primary benefits:
  - Increases speed - Because a large data stream is segmented into packets,
    large amounts of data can be sent over the network without tying up a
    communications link. This allows many different conversations to be
    interleaved on the network called multiplexing.

  - Increases efficiency -If a single segment is fails to reach its destination
    due to a failure in the network or network congestion, only that segment
    needs to be retransmitted instead of resending the entire data stream.

Sequencing refers to labeling the packets. 

Definitions: *
  - Data: The general term for the PDU used at the application layer
  - Segment: Transport layer PDU
  - Packet: Network layer PDU
  - Frame: Data Link layer PDU
  - Bits: Physical layer PDU used when physically transmitting data over the
    medium

Note: If the Transport header is TCP, then it is a segment. If the Transport
header is UDP then it is a datagram.

When messages are being sent on a network, the encapsulation process works from
top to bottom.

De-encapsulation is the process used by a receiving device to remove one or more
of the protocol headers.

3.7

Addresses
  - Network layer source and destination addresses - Responsible for delivering
    the IP packet from the original source to the final destination, which may
    be on the same network or a remote network.

  - Data link layer source and destination addresses - Responsible for
    delivering the data link frame from one network interface card (NIC) to
    another NIC on the same network.

The IP packet contains two IP Addresses:
  - Source IP address - The IP address of the sending device, which is the
    original source of the packet.
  
  - Destination IP address - The IP address of the receiving device, which is
    the final destination of the packet.

An IP address contains two parts:

  - Network portion (IPv4) or Prefix (IPv6) - The left-most part of the address
    that indicates the network in which the IP address is a member. All devices
    on the same network will have the same network portion of the address.
  
  - Host portion (IPv4) or Interface ID (IPv6) - The remaining part of the
    address that identifies a specific device on the network. This portion is
    unique for each device or interface on the network.

Esto no lo entiendo muy bien. *

MAC addresses are physically embedded on the Ethernet NIC.
  - Source MAC address - This is the data link address, or the Ethernet MAC
    address, of the device that sends the data link frame with the encapsulated
    IP packet. The MAC address of the Ethernet NIC of PC1 is AA-AA-AA-AA-AA-AA,
    written in hexadecimal notation. (Media Access Control)
    
  - Destination MAC address - When the receiving device is on the same network
    as the sending device, this is the data link address of the receiving
    device. In this example, the destination MAC address is the MAC address of
    the FTP server: CC-CC-CC-CC-CC-CC, written in hexadecimal notation.

4.1
Before any network communications can occur, a physical connection to a local
network must be established.

Devices on a wireless network must be connected to a wireless access point (AP)
or wireless router

These are the components of an access point:
  1 The wireless antennas
  2 Several Ethernet switchports
  3 An internet port

WLAN -> Wireless NIC.

The OSI physical layer provides the means to transport the bits that make up a
data link layer frame across the network media.

TCP/IP suite are defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)

the physical layer hardware, media, encoding, and signaling standards are
defined and governed by these standards organizations:
  - International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
  - Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronic Industries Association
    (TIA/EIA)
  - International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
  - American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
  - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
  - National telecommunications regulatory authorities including the Federal
    Communication Commission (FCC) in the USA and the European
    Telecommunications
  - Standards Institute (ETSI)
  
Local specifications
  - CSA (Canadian Standards Association)
  - CENELEC (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization)
  - JSA/JIS (Japanese Standards Association)
  
The TCP/IP standards are implemented in software and governed by the IETF.

The physical layer standars are implemented in hardware and are governed by many
organizations including:
  - ISO
  - ANSI/TIA
  - ITU-T
  - ANSI
  - IEE
  
The physical layer standards address three functional areas:
  - Physical Components: connectors that transmit the signals that represent the
    bits.
    
  - Encoding: Encoding or line encoding is a method of converting a stream of
    data bits into a predefined "code”.
    Manchester encoding represents a 0 bit by a high to low voltage transition
    
  - Signaling: The way that bits are represented is called the signaling
    method.

Bandwidth: The capacity at which a medium can carry data.
Bits are sent at the speed of electricity. The difference is the number of bits
that are transmitted per second.
 
Terms used to measure the quality of bandwidth include:
  - Latency: Amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given
    point to another.
    
  - Throughput: Measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given
    period of time.

    There are many factors that influence throughput:
      * The amount of traffic
      * The type of traffic
      * The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between
        source and destination
    
  - Goodput: measure of usable data transferred over a given period of time.

it will only take one segment in the path with low throughput to create a
bottleneck in the throughput of the entire network.

4.3

Networks use copper media because it is inexpensive, easy to install, and has
low resistance to electrical current. However, copper media is limited by
distance and signal interference. This is referred to as signal attenuation. For
this reason, all copper media must follow strict distance limitations as
specified by the guiding standards.

The timing and voltage values of the electrical pulses are also susceptible to
interference from two sources:

  - Electromagnetic interference (EMI) or radio frequency interference (RFI):
  Potential sources of EMI and RFI include radio waves and electromagnetic
  devices, such as fluorescent lights or electric motors.

  - Crosstalk:
   disturbance caused by the electric or magnetic fields of a signal on one wire
   to the signal in an adjacent wire.

4.4

UTP cabling conforms to the standards established jointly by the TIA/EIA.

The electrical characteristics of copper cabling are defined by the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)

Cables are placed into categories based on their ability to carry higher
bandwidth rates.

Cables are placed into categories based on their ability to carry higher
bandwidth rates. For example, Category 5 cable is used commonly in 100BASE-TX
Fast Ethernet installations. Other categories include Enhanced Category 5 cable,
Category 6, and Category 6a.

Categories of UTP Cable:

  - Category 3 was originally used for voice communication over voice lines, but
    later used for data transmission.
    
  - Category 5 and 5e is used for data transmission. Category 5 supports 100Mbps
    and Category 5e supports 1000 Mbps
    
  - Category 6 has an added separator between each wire pair to support higher
    speeds. Category 6 supports up to 10 Gbps.
    
  - Category 7 also supports 10 Gbps.
  
  - Category 8 supports 40 Gbps.

The TIA/EIA-568 standard describes the wire color codes to pin assignments
(pinouts) for Ethernet cables.

The following are the main cable types that are obtained by using specific
wiring conventions:

  - Ethernet Straight-through: The most common type of networking cable. It is
    commonly used to interconnect a host to a switch and a switch to a router.

  - Ethernet Crossover: A cable used to interconnect similar devices. For
    example, to connect a switch to a switch, a host to a host, or a router to a
    router. However, crossover cables are now considered legacy as NICs use
    medium-dependent interface crossover (auto-MDIX) to automatically detect the
    cable type and make the internal connection.

Fiber-optic cables are broadly classified into two types:
  - Single-mode fiber (SMF)
  - Multimode fiber (MMF)

SMF is popular in long-distance situations spanning hundreds of kilometers

MMFs are popular in LANs because they can be powered by low-cost LEDs. It
provides bandwidth up to 10 Gbps over link lengths of up to 550 meters.

One of the highlighted differences between MMF and SMF is the amount of
dispersion. Dispersion refers to the spreading out of a light pulse over time.
Increased dispersion means increased loss of signal strength. MMF has a greater
dispersion than SMF. That is why MMF can only travel up to 500 meters before
signal loss.

Fiber-optic cabling is now being used in four types of industry:
  - Enterprise Networks: Used for backbone cabling applications and
    interconnecting
  
  - infrastructure devices Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH): Used to provide always-on
    broadband services to homes and small businesses 
   
  - Long-Haul Networks: Used by service providers to connect countries and
    cities 

  - Submarine Cable Networks: Used to provide reliable high-speed, high-capacity
    solutions capable of surviving in harsh undersea environments at up to
    transoceanic distances. Search the internet for “submarine cables
    telegeography map” to view various maps online.

Fiber-Optic Conectors

Straight-Tip (ST) Connectors:
ST connectors were one of the first connector types used.

Subscriber Connector (SC) Connectors:
They are a widely-adopted LAN and WAN connector that uses a push-pull mechanism
to ensure positive insertion.

Lucent Connector (LC) Simplex Connectors:
LC simplex connectors are a smaller version of the SC connector. These are
sometimes called little or local connectors and are quickly growing in
popularity due to their smaller size.

Duplex Multimode LC Connectors:
A duplex multimode LC connector is similar to an LC simplex connector, but uses
a duplex connector.

Fiber patch cords are required for interconnecting infrastructure devices. The
use of color distinguishes between single-mode and multimode patch cords. A
yellow jacket is for single-mode fiber cables and orange (or aqua) for multimode
fiber cables.

Fiber Patch Cords:
  - SC-SC Multimode Patch Cord
  - LC-LC Single-Mode Patch Cord
  - ST-LC Multimode Patch Cord
  - SC-ST Single-Mode Patch Cord

4.6

These are the wireless standards:

  - Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) - Wireless LAN (WLAN) technology, commonly referred to
    as Wi-Fi. WLAN uses a contention-based protocol known as carrier sense
    multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). The wireless NIC must first
    listen before transmitting to determine if the radio channel is clear. If
    another wireless device is transmitting, then the NIC must wait until the
    channel is clear. Wi-Fi is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance. Wi-Fi is used
    with certified WLAN devices based on the IEEE 802.11 standards.

  - Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15) - This is a wireless personal area network (WPAN)
    standard, commonly known as “Bluetooth.” It uses a device pairing process to
    communicate over distances from 1 to 100 meters.

  - WiMAX (IEEE 802:16) - Commonly known as Worldwide Interoperability for
    Microware Access (WiMAX), this wireless standard uses a point-to-multipoint
    topology to provide wireless broadband access.

  - Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4) - Zigbee is a specification used for low-data rate,
    low-power communications. It is intended for applications that require
    short-range, low data-rates and long battery life. Zigbee is typically used
    for industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) environments such as wireless
    light switches and medical device data collection.

In general, a WLAN requires the following network devices:

  - Wireless Access Point (AP) - These concentrate the wireless signals from
    users and connect to the existing copper-based network infrastructure, such
    as Ethernet. Home and small business wireless routers integrate the
    functions of a router, switch, and access point into one device, as shown in
    the figure.
  
  - Wireless NIC adapters - These provide wireless communication capability to
    network hosts.

Teoría: 6 Purpose of the data link layer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.1
9/11/2023 15:41:18

The data link layer does the following:
  - Enables upper layers to access the media. The upper layer protocol is
    completely unaware of the type of media that is used to forward the data.

  - Accepts data, usually Layer 3 packets (i.e., IPv4 or IPv6), and encapsulates
    them into Layer 2 frames.

  - Controls how data is placed and received on the media.

  - Exchanges frames between endpoints over the network media.

  - Receives encapsulated data, usually Layer 3 packets, and directs them to the
    proper upper-layer protocol.

  - Performs error detection and rejects any corrupt frame.

In computer networks, a node is a device that can receive, create, store, or
forward data along a communications path.

IEEE 802 LAN/MAN standards are specific to Ethernet LANs, wireless LANs (WLAN),
wireless personal area networks (WPAN) and other types of local and metropolitan
area networks.

  - Logical Link Control (LLC) - This IEEE 802.2 sublayer communicates between
    the networking software at the upper layers and the device hardware at the
    lower layers. It places information in the frame that identifies which
    network layer protocol is being used for the frame. This information allows
    multiple Layer 3 protocols, such as IPv4 and IPv6, to use the same network
    interface and media.
   
  - Media Access Control (MAC) – Implements this sublayer (IEEE 802.3, 802.11,
    or 802.15) in hardware. It is responsible for data encapsulation and media
    access control. It provides data link layer addressing and it is integrated
    with various physical layer technologies.

The LLC sublayer takes the network protocol data, which is typically an IPv4 or
IPv6 packet, and adds Layer 2 control information to help deliver the packet to
the destination node.

The MAC sublayer controls the NIC and other hardware that is responsible for
sending and receiving data on the wired or wireless LAN/MAN medium.

The MAC sublayer provides data encapsulation:
  - Frame delimiting - The framing process provides important delimiters to
    identify fields within a frame. These delimiting bits provide
    synchronization between the transmitting and receiving nodes.

  - Addressing - Provides source and destination addressing for transporting the
    Layer 2 frame between devices on the same shared medium.

  - Error detection - Includes a trailer used to detect transmission errors.

Full-duplex communications do not require access control.

At each hop along the path, a router performs the following Layer 2 functions:
  - Accepts a frame from a medium
  - De-encapsulates the frame
  - Re-encapsulates the packet into a new frame
  - Forwards the new frame appropriate to the medium of that segment of the
    physical network

Engineering organizations that define open standards and protocols that apply to
the network access layer (i.e., the OSI physical and data link layers) include
the following:
  - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
  - International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
  - International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
  - American National Standards Institute (ANSI)

6.2

The data link layer must know the logical topology of a network in order to be
able to determine what is needed to transfer frames from one device to another.
This topic explains the ways in which the data link layer works with different
logical network topologies.

There are two types of topologies used when describing LAN and WAN networks:
  - Physical topology – Identifies the physical connections and how end devices
    and intermediary devices (i.e, routers, switches, and wireless access
    points) are interconnected. The topology may also include specific device
    location such as room number and location on the equipment rack. Physical
    topologies are usually point-to-point or star.
  
  - Logical topology - Refers to the way a network transfers frames from one
    node to the next. This topology identifies virtual connections using device
    interfaces and Layer 3 IP addressing schemes.

The data link layer "sees" the logical topology of a network when controlling
data access to the media. It is the logical topology that influences the type of
network framing and media access control used.

WAN topologies:

point-to-point: link between two endpoints.
Hub and Spoke: WAN version of the start topology.
Mesh: High availability, but expensive due to interconnectedness.

A hybrid is a variation or combination of any topologies.

Early star topologies interconnected end devices using Ethernet hubs.

Legacy LAN Topologies:
  - Bus - All end systems are chained to each other and terminated in some form
    on each end. Infrastructure devices such as switches are not required to
    interconnect the end devices. Legacy Ethernet networks were often bus
    topologies using coax cables because it was inexpensive and easy to set up.
  
  - Ring - End systems are connected to their respective neighbor forming a
    ring. The ring does not need to be terminated, unlike in the bus topology.
    Legacy Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) and Token Ring networks used
    ring topologies.

There are two common modes of duplex:
  - Half duplex communication: Both devices can transmit and receive on the
    media but cannot do so simultaneously.

  - Full-duplex communication: Both devices can simultaneously transmit and
    receive on the shared media.

It is important that two interconnected interfaces operate using the same duplex
mode. Otherwise, there will be a duplex mismatch creating inefficiency and
latency on the link.

A multiaccess network is a network that can have two or more end devices
attempting to access the network simultaneously.

In contention-based multiaccess networks, all nodes are operating in
half-duplex, competing for the use of the medium. However, only one device can
send at a time. Examples of contention-based access methods include the
following:
  - Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) used on
    legacy bus-topology Ethernet LANs
    
  - Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) used on
    Wireless LANs

In a controlled-based multiaccess network, each node has its own time to use the
medium. Inefficient. Examples of multiaccess networks that use controlled access
include the following:
  - Legacy Token Ring
  - Legacy ARCNET

Note: Today, Ethernet networks operate in full-duplex and do not require an
access method.

Examples of contention-based access networks include the following:
  - Wireless LAN (uses CSMA/CA)
  - Legacy bus-topology Ethernet LAN (uses CSMA/CD)
  - Legacy Ethernet LAN using a hub (uses CSMA/CD)

CMSA/CA does not detect collisions but attempts to avoid them by waiting before
transmitting.  Each device that transmits includes the time duration that it
needs for the transmission. All other wireless devices receive this information
and know how long the medium will be unavailable.

The information appended to a frame is determined by the protocol being used.

The data link protocol is responsible for NIC-to-NIC communications within the
same network.

Although there are many different data link layer protocols that describe data
link layer frames, each frame type has three basic parts:
  - Header
  - Data
  - Trailer

The structure of the frame and the fields contained in the header and trailer
vary according to the protocol.

There is no one frame structure that meets the needs of all data transportation
across all types of media. control information needed in the frame varies to
match the access control requirements of the media and logical topology. a WLAN
frame must include procedures for collision avoidance and therefore requires
additional control information when compared to an Ethernet frame.

in a fragile environment, more controls are needed to ensure delivery. The
header and trailer fields are larger as more control information is needed.

Frame fields include the following: Frame start and stop indicator flags -
Used to identify the beginning and end limits of the frame:
  - Addressing - Indicates the source and destination nodes on the media.

  - Type - Identifies the Layer 3 protocol in the data field.

  - Control - Identifies special flow control services such as quality of
    service (QoS). QoS gives forwarding priority to certain types of messages.
    For example, voice over IP (VoIP) frames normally receive priority because
    they are sensitive to delay.

  - Data - Contains the frame payload (i.e., packet header, segment header, and
    the data).

  - Error Detection - Included after the data to form the trailer.

the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value. This value is placed in the frame check
sequence (FCS) field to represent the contents of the frame.

The data link layer address is only used for local delivery. Addresses at this
layer have no meaning beyond the local network.

Ethernet protocols are used by wired LANs. Wireless communications fall under
WLAN (IEEE 802.11) protocols.
  - Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
  - High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC)
  - Frame Relay
  - Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
  - X.25
These Layer 2 protocols are now being replaced in the WAN by Ethernet.

The difference in bandwidth normally results in the use of different protocols
for LANs and WANs. Data link layer protocols include:
  - Ethernet
  - 802.11 Wireless
  - Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
  - High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC)
  - Frame Relay

Ethernet operates in the data link layer and the physical layer. It is a family
of networking technologies defined in the IEEE 802.2 and 802.3 standards.
Ethernet supports data bandwidths of the following:
  - 10 Mbps
  - 100 Mbps
  - 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps)
  - 10,000 Mbps (10 Gbps)
  - 40,000 Mbps (40 Gbps)
  - 100,000 Mbps (100 Gbps)

[IA]: Ethernet can be described as a combination of standards, a technology, and
a set of protocols used for local area networking. 

Ethernet is defined by data link layer and physical layer protocols:
  - Physical layer and Data Link MAC are part of the 802.3
  - Data link LLC is part of the 802.2
  
IEEE 802 LAN/MAN protocols, including Ethernet, use the following two separate
sublayers of the data link layer to operate. They are the Logical Link Control
(LLC) and the Media Access Control (MAC), as shown in the figure.
  
LLC Sublayer - This IEEE 802.2 sublayer communicates between the networking
software at the upper layers and the device hardware at the lower layers.   

MAC Sublayer - This sublayer (IEEE 802.3, 802.11, or 802.15 for example) is
implemented in hardware and is responsible for data encapsulation and media
access control. 

The MAC sublayer is responsible for data encapsulation and accessing the
media.

IEEE 802.3 data encapsulation includes the following:
  - Ethernet frame - This is the internal structure of the Ethernet frame.

  - Ethernet Addressing - The Ethernet frame includes both a source and
    destination MAC address to deliver the Ethernet frame from Ethernet NIC to
    Ethernet NIC on the same LAN.

  - Ethernet Error detection - The Ethernet frame includes a frame check
    sequence (FCS) trailer used for error detection.

he IEEE 802.3 MAC sublayer includes the specifications for different Ethernet
communications standards over various types of media including copper and
fiber.
  - IEEE 802.3u: Fast Ethernet
  - IEEE 802.3z: Gigabit Ethernet over Fiber
  - IEEE 802.3ab Gigabit Ethernet over Copper
  - IEEE 802.3ae: 10 Gigabit Ethernet over Fiber

Ethernet over a half-duplex medium uses a contention-based access method,
carrier sense multiple access/collision detection (CSMA/CD)

The minimum Ethernet frame size is 64 bytes and the expected maximum is 1518
bytes. This includes all bytes from the destination MAC address field through
the frame check sequence (FCS) field. The preamble field is not included when
describing the size of the frame.

Any frame less than 64 bytes in length is considered a “collision fragment” or
“runt frame” and is automatically discarded by receiving stations. Frames with
more than 1500 bytes of data are considered “jumbo” or “baby giant frames”.

Jumbo frames are usually supported by most Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet
switches and NICs.

Ethernet Frame Fields Detail:

  - Preamble and Start Frame Delimiter Fields: The Preamble (7 bytes) and Start
    Frame Delimiter (SFD), also called the Start of Frame (1 byte), fields are
    used for synchronization between the sending and receiving devices. These
    first eight bytes of the frame are used to get the attention of the
    receiving nodes. Essentially, the first few bytes tell the receivers to get
    ready to receive a new frame.

  - Destination MAC Address Field: This 6-byte field is the identifier for the
    intended recipient. As you will recall, this address is used by Layer 2 to
    assist devices in determining if a frame is addressed to them. The address
    in the frame is compared to the MAC address in the device. If there is a
    match, the device accepts the frame. Can be a unicast, multicast or
    broadcast address.

  - Source MAC Address Field: This 6-byte field identifies the originating NIC
    or interface of the frame.

  - Type / Length: This 2-byte field identifies the upper layer protocol
    encapsulated in the Ethernet frame. Common values are, in hexadecimal, 0x800
    for IPv4, 0x86DD for IPv6 and 0x806 for ARP.

  - Data Field: This field (46 - 1500 bytes) contains the encapsulated data from
    a higher layer, which is a generic Layer 3 PDU, or more commonly, an IPv4
    packet. All frames must be at least 64 bytes long. If a small packet is
    encapsulated, additional bits called a pad are used to increase the size of
    the frame to this minimum size.

  - Frame Check Sequence Field: The Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field (4 bytes)
    is used to detect errors in a frame. It uses a cyclic redundancy check
    (CRC). The sending device includes the results of a CRC in the FCS field of
    the frame. The receiving device receives the frame and generates a CRC to
    look for errors. If the calculations match, no error occurred. Calculations
    that do not match are an indication that the data has changed; therefore,
    the frame is dropped. A change in the data could be the result of a
    disruption of the electrical signals that represent the bits.

El sistema operativo de los switches es IOS -> Internetworking Operating System
heredado de UNIX

UNIX fue el primer OS que tenía capacidades de redes

Este sistema operativo tiene dos prompts ->
  Switch> guest - user
  Switch# root  - privileged

> enable -> Salta a modo privilegiado
# disable -> Regresa a modo invitado

Siempre que lleguemos a clase, haremos el proceso de limpieza: *
# show startup-config -> ideal: startup-config not present
# erase startup-config -> Limpiar configuración
# reload -> Renicia el equipo

- Cuando aparece More -
Enter -> una línea más
Space -> un pantallazo más
Otra tecla -> Aborta

Comandos:

1. Fecha/hora
Es importante configurar la fecha y hora para los temas de seguridad es muy
importante para re-construir cómo sucedió un ataque.
Estos equipos guardan logs y la marca de tiempo debe ser configurada
correctamente por esto

# show clock -> Muestra la hora actual.
UTC Mon Mar 1 1993: Fecha icónica en la que se hizo release

Ajustar zona horaria

Las configuraciones se hacen en submodos del modo privilegiado, como el submodo
configuración global

# configure terminal -> Pasar al submodo configuración global

(config)# clock timezone COT -5

(config)# exit -> Regresa a privilegiado

# clock set TIME MONTH DAY YEAR

2. Configurar un nombre al y demás equipo

(config)# hostname WORD -> This system's network name

Asegurar el modo privilegiado

3. Asegurar el modo privilegiado

(config)# enable password WORD -> En este curso usamos cisco o class

Esta contraseña ya no se usa porque se guarda en texto plano.

# show running-config -> Mostrar configuración

4. Contraseña segura del privilegiado

(config)# enable secret WORD -> class para esta clase

Si está password, se usa para entrar, si ambas están presente, solo te deja
pasar con secret

Algoritmos de cifrado
-5 MD5
-9 SCRYPT

Quitar las configuraciones mencionadas anteriormente
# nohostname
# noenable password
# noenable secret

5. Mensaje del día 
Para que no les den libertad en la corte

(config)# banner motd $Propiedad privada$

Router:
  (config)# interface g0/0/0
  (config if)# ip address 10.0.0.x 255.0.0.0
  (config if)# no shutdown

ping IP

TELNET -> Protocolo para configuraciones

(config)# line vty <0-97> -> Cantidad de personas que se pueden conectar
(config-line)# password WORD -> Para esta clase ciscovty
(config-line)# login
(config-line)# transport input telnet

Telnet se accede desde Putty

Configurar contraseña para conectarse por consola
(config-line)# line console 0
(config-line)# password ciscocon
(config-line)# login

Ambas contraseña están en texto plano en show running config

(config-line)# service password-encryption -> Encriptar contraseñas (débil)

Reglas

Comunicación unicast, es decir, uno a uno. 
Comunicación broadcast, es decir, de uno a todos. En español le llaman
  difusión.
Comunicación multicast, es decir, de uno a un grupo en particular. Por ejemplo,
  la televisión digital es un multicast. En el que el decodificador usa
  protocolos para unirse o desligarse de una conexión multicast.

El broadcast es ineficiente porque perturba en la red.

Los protocolos son las reglas de comunicación. Llegar a un acuerdo en estos fue
un proceso difícil.

ISO -> International Organization for Standardization

El modelo OSI intenta explicar cómo funcionan las telecomunicaciones y lo hace
  mediante un modelo de 7 capas.

  7. Capa de aplicación (programas)
  6. Presentación (ASCII, gif, png)
  5. Sesión (MySQL)
  4. Transporte
  3. Red
  2. Enlace de datos
  1. Física

En las capas 5 - 7 la información se llama data.

La información viaja en segmentos, los cuales están compuestos por un header y
un payload. Diferentes capas agregan diferentes encabezados.

Data -> Segment -> Packet -> Frame -> Bits 
5-7     4          3         2        1

La PDU se refiere al nombre de la información en cada paso.

Unidad de transmisión máxima (MTU) En Ethernet es 1500Bytes (Solo data)

El modelo OSI no se usa, es meramente de referencia y para explicaciones
  académicas
  
Se termina la sesión.

El modelo que se usa en la vida real es el modelo TCP/IP, el cual consta solo
con 4 capas.

Modelo OSI comparado con el modelo TCP/IP

7. Capa de aplicación (programas)     | App         |
6. Presentación (ASCII, gif, png)     | App         |

1. Física                             |     red     |

En este curso se habla con un enfoque LAN, si se toca el tema de cable coaxial,
se refiere a conectar coaxial entre ordenadores.

4. Medios - Capa 1 Física
  - Cobre: Conductor barato desde las líneas telefónicas. Inició como un
    coaxial. 
    
    La instalación y el costo son atractivos. Sin embargo, la señal se
    degrada con interferiencias electromagnéticas y radiofrecuencias. 
    
    Baja velocidad, 10 Mbps máximo.

    Desconectaba otros usuario al conectar nuevos equipos a la red.

    Coaxial grueso: 10BASE5 (Thick) 500m máximo, luego un repetidor (elemento
    activo, dado que necesita una fuente de energía para repetir la señal).

    Coaxial delgado: 10BASE2 (Thin) 175m máximo, es más usuado para las
    computadoras al interior. 

    Las redes coaxiales salen del panorama por sus contras, por ello
    evolucionamos al pan trenzado, sin embargo, sigue siendo cobre. Tiene 8
    pines (Verde, Naranja, Café, Azul y sus tierra).

    El par trenzado tiene 4 canales, por lo que el ancho de banda
    aumenta. Dado que puede recibir y transmitir al mismo tiempo. Tiene una
    distancia máxima de 100m.
    10BASET -> Ethernet
    100BASETX -> FastEthernet
    1000BASET -> GigabitEthernet

    Un conductor lineal se convierte en una antena receptora de señales. *

    Los pares entre sí no se afectan, pero sí las frecuencias parásitas.
    EMI/RFI.

    El par trenzado inció en los 80 y hasta el día de hoy sigue siendo usado por
    sus ventajas.

    El par trenzado más sencillo lo llamamos UTP -> Unshielded twisted pair.
    Par trenzado recubierto STP, FTP -> Shielded twisted pair. Full, cables
    only.

    La pantalla o shield refleja las interferencias.

    Es mejor pasar a la fibra óptica que pasar a STP. *
    
  - Fibra
  - Wireless

A esta fecha 9/1/2023 13:16:40 Hay fibra desde el M2 hasta el M5.

Entender el half-duplex, full duplex, tx, rx la clase lamentablemente se cortó
cuando lo estaba explicando.

Fue ayer, no estuve en clase porque me tomé muy literal el horario en NetAcad,
sin embargo, lo que se hizo fue crimpear RJ45.

Hay dos estándares:
  - T568A
  - T568B
  
También hay cables straight-trough y crossover. Los straight-trough tienen la
particularidad de tener ambas terminaciones iguales, sin embargo, los crossover
no, se adaptan a las necesidades de transmisión y recepción de señales. Por
suerte el auto MDIX detecta cómo mandar las señales y donde está implementado no
hace falta crimpear el cable de una forma en particular. El estándar más usado
es el T568B.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Novena clase
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

En este capítulo se introduce la fibra. Donde se usa la luz para transmitir
información, una de las grandes ventajas es que no tiene los problemas
EMI/RFI. Además las distancias empiezan a ser de kilómetros. Sin embargo, es
costosa. La instalación es más compleja y crimpear el cable también.

La fibra tiene dos modalidades.
  - Monomodo: Solo viaja una haz de luz en la fibra. El cable es generalmente
    amarillo. Un láser emite el haz de luz, pero es muy costoso.
    
  - Multimodo: Viajan varios haces de luz en reflección, pero nunca se chocan.
    El cable es generalmente naranja, usa un LED y es más barata.
    (La más popular) [Más gruesa] {Menor distancia que la Monomodo}

La fibra tiene varios tipos de conectores.

La fibra no es negociable. A diferencia de los cables de cobre, donde puedes
conectar a interfaces de velocidad diferente y trabajará a la velocidad más
limitante.

La fibra trabaja Full Duplex.

Cualquier impureza en la fibra causaría que deje de funcionar.

El siguiente medio es el medio no guiado o medios inalámbricos.

Inició con la radio, pero era una transmisión unidireccional. Luego cada empresa
nuevamente inició a solucionar el problema de transmisión por su lado hasta que
llegó la estandarización de Alliance WiFi y IEE 802.11 LAN o WLAN en el año
1997.

En ese entonces la frecuencia usada era 2.4GHz con una banda ancha de 2Mbps, era
poco atractivo debido a su velocidad, por lo que la IEEE empezó a anexar.
1 - Legacy 1997 2.4Ghz 2Mbps.
  
2 - Anexo a 1999 -> 802.11a: 5Ghz 54Mbps. Le custa superar obstáculos, pero va a
    más velocidad.
    
2 - Anexo b 1999 -> 802.11b: 2.4Ghz 11Mbps. Supera obstáculos con más
    facilidad, pero es más lenta.

3 - Anexo g 2003 -> 2.4Ghz 54Mbps. Esta tomó lo mejor de las anteriores.

4 - Anexo n 2009 -> 2.4Ghz/5Ghz. 600Mbps. Debe tener 4 antenas, cada antena de
    aproximadamente 150.

5 - Anexo ac 2013 -> 5Ghz. 1.3Gbps. Se hizo tan popular el 2.4Ghz que se saturó.

6 - Anexo ax 2020 -> 2.4Ghz/5Ghz. 9Gbps. El famoso Wi-Fi 6.

Las frecuencias pertenecen al estado. En Colombia es la Agencia Nacional del
Espectro, estos se encargan de licenciar las frecuencias y cobrar a las
entidades que las usan.

Las redes 3G, 4G, 5G, emisoras de radio, canales de televisión usan estas
frecuencias y deben pagar por su uso. La excepción es 2.4Ghz y 5Ghz, dado que no
son licenciadas.

Access point -> Es una especie de HUB

Cisco vendía la WPC300N, esta trae GUI. 

Asociar W en PT a b/g, es decir 2.4GHz.

SSID -> Nombre de la red.
Auth -> Contraseña (seguridad)

802.3 -> Ethernet standard.

Capa 2, Data Link, Enlace de datos. => Control de acceso, tiene control de
errores.

Capa 2 Lan protocolos -> Ethernet, WLAN, Token Ring, Fool.
Capa 2 WAN protocolos -> PPP, MPLS, HDLC, FrameRelay, ATM.

Topologías LAN

Bus -> Dejo de usarse porque es poco atractivo desconectar otros usuarios al
escalar.

Estrella -> Se queda sin conexión si el centro falla.

Anillo -> Dejó de usarse porque un fallo deja la topología sin internet.

Topologías WAN

P2P -> Conexión entre dos WAN
Hub & Spoke | Malla parcial -> Conexión entre varias WAN.
Mesh | Malla completa -> Conexión con todos.

Formas de hablar en redes.

Determinística | por turnos:
  - Token: Recuerda token ring, tecnología de IBM, topología en anillo y
    necesitaba dos tarjetas.
    
  - FDDI: Usaba fibra y necesita dos tarjetas de fibra.

No determinístico | Contienda
  - Ethernet: Escucho, si el medio está ocupado, espero, si el medio está libre,
    envío.

Ethernet es de los más populares. Nación en Hawaii.

LLC y MAC son las subdivisiones de la capa 2.
Si cambia la capa física, cambia el MAC, si cambia la capa 3, la que cambia es
la LLC.

Norma MAC: 802.3
Norma LLC: 802.2

OUI -> Primeros 24 bits de la MAC, puede ser constante por proveedor.

Todos F en la MAC implica broadcast.

Los frames tienen:
  - Header
    - DST MAC
    - SRC MAC
    - Type/L => MTU: 0x05dc, tipo => 0x800, 0x0806, 0x0842
  - payload
    - Mayor a 46 y menor a 1500
  - Trailer
    FCS => Frame Checksum
    CRC-4 => Suma polinomica

Recuerda que antes hay un preambulo que prepara al dispositivo para escuchar.

En entornos más seguros se usa md5, SHA1, lo cual tiene sumas únicas.

El HUB es un loro que solo repite.
el Switch entiende las tramas y toma decisiones.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Décima tercera clase
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

El switch solo maneja la capa 2.

#show ip interface brief -> Inventario de interfaces
#show interface fa0/1 o gi1/0/1 -> Checkear MAC

Cuando se hace ping a un switch, la MAC es la de vlan1

El switch construye la tabla MAC, la cual asocia puerto con MAC

#show mac address-table

Eth -> dst, src
ip -> src, dst

Ya hay examen de los capítulos 4 - 7. Hasta el domingo primero.

El hub es un dispositivo de capa 1, de modo que solo ve voltaje.
El concentrador replica la señal por todos los puertos exceptuando el puerto por
el que lo recibió. El hub además usa un ancho de banda compartido, entre más
dispostivos, más ancho de banda se consume. Los hub hacen unicasts sucesivos, no
broadcast, a esto se le llama flood. Los hubs usan half-duplex. Las colisiones
son comúnes en los hubs.

La portadora es figurarse cuando hay una bajada en voltaje para permitir o otro
dispositivo hablar. 
CSMA/XX => Carrier Sense multiple access, censado de portadora.
XXXX/CD => Collision detection. Cuando llegan señales extrañas que no se pueden
entender. Se hace un back-off con un tiempo determinado a cada computador para
escuchar otra vez.

Switches tienen buffers cuando reciben paquetes al tiempo.

Construcción de la tabla MAC:
SRC - aprende dirección de source
DST - decide, si no la tiene, hace un flooding, el cual es unicast para cada
port.
