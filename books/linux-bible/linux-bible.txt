Chapter 1: Starting with Linux
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"The operating Systems war is over, and Linux has won."

Linux is a computer operating system. An operating system consists of the
software that manages your computer and lets you run applications on it.

Linux differs from other operating systems because it is open source.

On Monday, August 26, 1991 at 2:12:08 AM UTC-4, Linus Benedict Torvalds wrote:
  Hello everybody out there using minix -
 
  I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and
  professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since
  april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people
  like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of
  the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).
 
  I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work.  This
  implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and I'd like to
  know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I
  won't promise I'll implement them :-)

  PS. Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs.  It is
  NOT protable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support
  anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(.

UNIX started as an open source operating system, but started selling UNIX by
1984.

In 1984, Richard M. Stallman started the GNU project (https://gnu.org),
recursively named by the phrase GNU is Not UNIX. GNU was intended to become a
recoding of the entire UNIX operating system that could be freely distributed.

Over time, the term free software has been mostly replaced by the term open
source soft- ware. The term free software is preferred by the Free Software
Foundation, while open source software is promoted by the Open Source Initiative

MacOS is built on a BSD derivative.

Today, Linux can be described as an open source UNIX-like operating system that
reflects a combination of SVID, POSIX, and BSD compliance.

A Linux distribution consists of the components needed to create a working Linux
system and the procedures needed to get those components installed and running.

Nearly every major Linux distribution that offers desktop interfaces is based on
the X Window System originally from the X.Org Foundation. The X Window System
(sometimes simply called X) was created before Linux existed, and it even
predates Microsoft Windows.

A window manager adds the capability to manage the windows on your desktop and
often provides menus for launching applications and otherwise working with the
desktop.

Lightweight -> twm, fluxbox
Robust -> GNOME, KDE

Press Ctrl+Alt+Tab to display additional desktop areas to select.
Press Alt+F2 to display a command box. Type the name of the command that you
want to run into the box.

Chapter 3: Using the shell
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before icons and windows took over computer screens, you typed commands to
interact with most computers. On UNIX systems, from which Linux was derived, the
program used to interpret and manage commands was referred to as the shell.

Other shells are available, including the C shell (csh), which is popular among
BSD UNIX users, and the Korn shell (ksh), which is popular among UNIX System V
users. Linux also has a tcsh shell (an improved C shell) and an ash shell
(another Bourne shell look-alike).

Many Linux system administrators use shell scripts to automate tasks such as
backing up data, monitoring log files, or checking system health.

$ -> Regular user
# -> Root user

Ctrl+Alt+F1 (or F2, F3, F4, and so on up to F6).

Newer systems, such as Fedora 29, now start the gdm (the login screen)
persistently on tty1 to allow multiple simultaneous GUI sessions: the gdm is on
tty1, the first desktop is started on tty2, the second desktop is started on
tty3, and so on.

Find out default login shell.
$ who am i
$ grep chris /etc/passwd

/home/kuervo:/bin/bash -> Deafult login shell

$ date
Tue Jun 11 11:26:56 PM -05 2024

$ hostname
fedora

Same command
$ ls -l -a -t
$ ls -lat

Whole words options
$ command --help

Argument
$ cat /etc/passwd

For full-word options, the argument often follows an equal sign (=)

$ ls --hide=Desktop

Information about current login session.

$ who -uH
NAME     LINE         TIME             IDLE          PID COMMENT
kuervo   seat0        2024-06-11 22:49   ?          2137 (login screen)
kuervo   :0           2024-06-11 22:49   ?          2137 (:0)

$ echo $PATH
/home/kuervo/.local/bin:/home/kuervo/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/home/kuervo/bin:/home/kuervo/bin

Some commands are built into the shell.

Determine location of a particular command
$ type bash
bash is /usr/bin/bash

$ locate hola
/home/kuervo/repos/arkham/src/Game.js

If no matches, run updatedb

If you prefer the vi command for editing shell command lines, you can easily
make that happen. Add the following line to the .bashrc file in your home
directory:

set -o vi

$ -> Shell completes the text with a variable from the current shell.
~ -> Shell completes with username.
@ -> Shell completes with hostname taken from /etc/hosts file.

Recall commands
$ history 2

!n -> Run command number
!! -> Run previous command
!?string? -> Run command containing string

fc followed by a history line number.

Ctrl-R -> Reverse incremental search
Ctrl-S -> Forward incremental search
Alt-P -> Reverse Search
Alt-N -> Forward Search

Disable HISTFILE 
Prevent storing a shell's history by killing it. 

$ kill -9 processID

Metacharacters -> |, &, ;, ), (, <, >

Pipe connects the output from one command to the input of another command.

$ cat /etc/passwd | sort | less

gunzip < /usr/share/man/man1/grep.1.gz | nroff -c -man | less

Sequential commands are separated with semicolons.

$ date ; troff -me -verylargedocument | lpr ; date

Background commands (&).

$ troff -me verylargedocument | lpr &

Expading commands
$(command) or `command`

vi $(find /home | grep xyzzy)

Expand arithmetic expressions

$[expression]
$(expression)

$ echo "There are $(ls | wc -w) files in this directory"

Expanding variables
$ ls -l $BASH

Shell variables
$SHELL -> Identifies the shell you are using
$PS1 -> Defines shell prompt
$MAIL -> Location of user's mailbox

See variables 
$ set

BASH=/bin/bash
...

Environment variables
$ env

SHELL=/bin/bash
...

$ alias p='pwd ; ls -CF'
$ alias rm='rm -i'

PS1 can be changed in .bashrc.

man -k passwd

chgpasswd (8)        - update group passwords in batch mode
chpasswd (8)         - update passwords in batch mode
...
