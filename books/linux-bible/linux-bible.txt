Chapter 1: Starting with Linux
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"The operating Systems war is over, and Linux has won."

Linux is a computer operating system. An operating system consists of the
software that manages your computer and lets you run applications on it.

Linux differs from other operating systems because it is open source.

On Monday, August 26, 1991 at 2:12:08 AM UTC-4, Linus Benedict Torvalds wrote:
  Hello everybody out there using minix -
 
  I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and
  professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since
  april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people
  like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of
  the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).
 
  I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work.  This
  implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and I'd like to
  know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I
  won't promise I'll implement them :-)

  PS. Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs.  It is
  NOT protable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support
  anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(.

UNIX started as an open source operating system, but started selling UNIX by
1984.

In 1984, Richard M. Stallman started the GNU project (https://gnu.org),
recursively named by the phrase GNU is Not UNIX. GNU was intended to become a
recoding of the entire UNIX operating system that could be freely distributed.

Over time, the term free software has been mostly replaced by the term open
source soft- ware. The term free software is preferred by the Free Software
Foundation, while open source software is promoted by the Open Source Initiative

MacOS is built on a BSD derivative.

Today, Linux can be described as an open source UNIX-like operating system that
reflects a combination of SVID, POSIX, and BSD compliance.

A Linux distribution consists of the components needed to create a working Linux
system and the procedures needed to get those components installed and running.

Nearly every major Linux distribution that offers desktop interfaces is based on
the X Window System originally from the X.Org Foundation. The X Window System
(sometimes simply called X) was created before Linux existed, and it even
predates Microsoft Windows.

A window manager adds the capability to manage the windows on your desktop and
often provides menus for launching applications and otherwise working with the
desktop.

Lightweight -> twm, fluxbox
Robust -> GNOME, KDE

Press Ctrl+Alt+Tab to display additional desktop areas to select.
Press Alt+F2 to display a command box. Type the name of the command that you
want to run into the box.
