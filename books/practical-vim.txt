:edit! -> Undo all changes done to a file
:wall -> Writes all changes to the files

Part IV:
Registers

Addressing a Register
  "{register}

Black hole register -> "_

Unnamed register -> "_

The Yank register -> "_
 
The expression Register -> "_

Name of the current file -> "%

Name of the alternate file -> "#

Last insterted text -> ".

Last Ex command -> ":

Last search pattern -> "/

:reg a -> Contens of register a

insert mode <C-r>{register} -> paste contents of register

Macros

Keep in mind keyboard codes in macros, page 181 in the book.

q{register} -> record macro.
q -> stop recording.

@{register} -> play macro.
@@ -> play last macro.

:'<,'>normal @a -> Play macro in "series".

q{Mayus register} -> Appends to a macro
  qa -> record.
  qA -> append.

:let @a=substitute(@a, '\', 'vU', 'g') -> Substitutes in the macro.
  look up :h function-list for more ideas.

Part V: Patterns

Matching patterns and literals Mathcing 

:set ignoracase -> Set case sensitivity globally

\c -> ignore case
\C -> forces case sensitivity
\v -> enable \v pattern switch (very magic search)
\V -> enable very no magic search
  the pattern after it, only the backlash has a special meaning

See character classes \x
  :h /character-classes

/\v(%(And|D)rew) (Neil) -> register 1 : (Andrew | Drew), register 2: (Neil)

:%s//\2, \1/g -> Substitutes register 1 and 2.

/\v<the> -> This will only find "the".

\zs marks the start of a match.
\ze matches the end of a match.
