Play usually follows this format:
  - The gamemaster outlines some siutation or encounter.
  - Next, you and the other players say what your characters propose to do.
  - The gamemaster responds through the actions or words of nonplayers
    characters, monsters, or the environment.
  - If an outcome is in doubt and is important to the progress of the story,
    roll dice to determine what happens, using the characters' abilities as
    guidelines.
  - You and the other players respond in turn.

As such, the gamemaster should think of themselves as the host of a party. Make
sure everyone is having a good time, check periodically that everything is fine,
and pay special attention to any behavior or language that can take away from
other players' experience.
