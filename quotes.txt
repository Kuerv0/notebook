We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton.

In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here. Dawkins, Richard. Unweaving the Rainbow, editorial, date, p. page.

Science is about identifying certain phenomena (through observing and recording), whereas engineering takes such findings and uses them to produce practical applications, such as machines, structures, and materials.
