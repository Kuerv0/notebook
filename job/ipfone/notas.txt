                         Effective Communication Skills
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

    A University of Pittsburgh study found that the most important factor in
                  selecting managers is communication skills.

If you can communicate well, you can get your message across to others in an
effective way, otherwise the messages you send get lost in translation. 

There are many individuals struggling to convey their thoughts and ideas in an
accurate manner. However these skills can be practiced and learned.

                                  Definition:
      Communication is the art and process of creating and sharing ideas.

                                  Definition:
    Communication skills are the tools that we use to remove the barriers to
                            effective communication.

To be successful at communicating, it's important to recognize that these
barriers to communication can occur at multiple points in the communication
process.

The communication process is composed of several stages, each of which offers
potential barriers to succcessful communication.

- Source   : Origin
- Message  : Information
- Encoding : Transformation
- Channel  : Method
- Decoding : Interpreting
- Receiver : Destination after barriers
- Feedback : Insight
- Context  : Environment

We all come to each communication exchange with our 'filter' through which we
see the world. This means we differ in perspective with the person we are
communicating with.

The same words can have very different meanings depending on how we interpret
them. We can't always be certain that the other person will read or heart. 

                                              "Effective listeners remember that 
                                    words have no meaning - people have meaning"
                                                                    Larry Barker

Factors such as past experiences, our prejudices, our feelings, and our
environment affect how we communicate.
