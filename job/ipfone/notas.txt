                         Effective Communication Skills
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

    A University of Pittsburgh study found that the most important factor in
                  selecting managers is communication skills.

If you can communicate well, you can get your message across to others in an
effective way, otherwise the messages you send get lost in translation. 

There are many individuals struggling to convey their thoughts and ideas in an
accurate manner. However these skills can be practiced and learned.

                                  Definition:
      Communication is the art and process of creating and sharing ideas.

                                  Definition:
    Communication skills are the tools that we use to remove the barriers to
                            effective communication.

To be successful at communicating, it's important to recognize that these
barriers to communication can occur at multiple points in the communication
process.

The communication process is composed of several stages, each of which offers
potential barriers to succcessful communication.
