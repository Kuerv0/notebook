                         Effective Communication Skills
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

    A University of Pittsburgh study found that the most important factor in
                  selecting managers is communication skills.

If you can communicate well, you can get your message across to others in an
effective way, otherwise the messages you send get lost in translation. 

There are many individuals struggling to convey their thoughts and ideas in an
accurate manner. However these skills can be practiced and learned.

                                  Definition:
      Communication is the art and process of creating and sharing ideas.

                                  Definition:
    Communication skills are the tools that we use to remove the barriers to
                            effective communication.

To be successful at communicating, it's important to recognize that these
barriers to communication can occur at multiple points in the communication
process.

The communication process is composed of several stages, each of which offers
potential barriers to succcessful communication.

- Source   : Origin
- Message  : Information
- Encoding : Transformation
- Channel  : Method
- Decoding : Interpreting
- Receiver : Destination after barriers
- Feedback : Insight
- Context  : Environment

We all come to each communication exchange with our 'filter' through which we
see the world. This means we differ in perspective with the person we are
communicating with.

The same words can have very different meanings depending on how we interpret
them. We can't always be certain that the other person will read or heart. 

                                              "Effective listeners remember that 
                                    words have no meaning - people have meaning"
                                                                    Larry Barker

Factors such as past experiences, our prejudices, our feelings, and our
environment affect how we communicate.

Since your well being fluctuates, it makes sense that the way you communicate
will change somewhat with how well you are feeling.

Recognizing how the environment might be affecting others you communicate with is
a skill that can come in handy.

In face-to-face communication, our words are only part of the message, body
language, tone of voice and physical communication are also relevant.

                               Over half of the information we send to others is
                                                     through non-verbal methods.

It's not what you say, it's how you say it that matters the most in relaying
your message.

Communication style refers to the choices we tend to make when communicating to
others.

Dr. Eileen Russo shows that there are two different dimensions in communication
styles: the level of expresssiveness and the level of assertiveness.

Assertive tell others what to do while less assertive ask others what should be
done.

Expressive styles show emotion, less expressive styles refrain from showing.

LE + LA = Systematic  | Logical, detail-focused.
LE + HA = Direct      | Straightforward, no-nonsense.
HE + HA = Spirited    | Energetic, persuasive.
HE + LA = Considerate | Empathetic, tactful

H = High  L = Low  A = Assertiveness  E = Expressiveness

Listening allows you to 'decode' the messages that you are receiving, but it
also allows you to help others communicate better.

Take your time to become self-aware of your own listening behavior in different
scenarios.

Active listening means being as attentive and involved in the conversation as
possible. Key aspects to become an active listener are: 

  - Pay close attention.
  - Demonstate physically that you are listening.
  - Check for understanding.
  - Do not interrupt.
  - Respond appropriately.

Written communication is more important than ever, yet very few people can
write well.

Meeting choices, answers to quick questions and quick clarifications are all
easy to complete with written communication.

Lengthy discussions by written communication (email) are not efficient, and
each exchange risks meaning getting lost.

Written communication alone does not allow for non verbal communication - the
most important aspect of getting your meaning across.

The higher the level of formality, the more likely you will use written
communication.

When writing emails:
- Choose a descriptive subject line.
- Put the main point first.
- Know your audience.
- Organize your message accordingly.
